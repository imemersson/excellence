               <h2>Excellence?</h2>
               
               <p id="quote-one">Unleash the beauty of your personality!</p>
               
               <p>Excellence is not just about achieving the highest possible
                 standards, but also about consistently striving to improve 
                 and grow in your abilities and skills. When you commit yourself 
                 to excellence, you become a standout performer in your field or 
                 industry. Your work  is  recognized  as xceptional and is 
                 highly valued by others. Moreover, when you aim for excellence,
                 you develop a reputation for being someone who can be relied 
                 upon to produce high-quality work consistently.</p> 
                
                <p>This reputation can open doors  to new opportunities,  whether
                    it  be  a  promotion,  a new job, or recognition from peers 
                    and superiors. Ultimately, excellence is a mindset that 
                    permeates all aspects of your life. It requires a willingness
                    to put in the effort and discipline needed to achieve your 
                    goals, as well as the ability to continually learn and adapt
                    as circumstances change. By embracing excellence as a guiding 
                    principle, you can become the best version of yourself and 
                    stand out from the crowd in a meaningful way.</p>

                <h2>Excellence earns respect.</h2>

                <p>When you achieve excellence, you earn the respect of others in 
                    your field or industry. Your peers and superiors will 
                    recognize your skills, expertise, and dedication, and you will 
                    become known as someone who can be relied upon to produce 
                    outstanding work. </p>

                <p>The image above implies that fostering excellence as a young 
                    citizen is important for personal growth, success, and 
                    contributing to society. To do so, young citizens should 
                    set high standards for themselves and their work, practice 
                    discipline and consistency, seek feedback  and  mentorship 
                    embrace challenges and failures as opportunities to learn 
                    and grow, and pursure their passions with dedication and
                    enthusiasm. </p>

                <p id="quote-two">"The excellence of youth lies not in their age, but in 
                    their attitude towards striving for greatness."</p>

                <p>By cultivating these qualities, young citizens can develop 
                    the skills and qualities necessary to excel in their chosen 
                    fields, make meaningful contributions to their communities, 
                    and become responsible and engaged members of society. </p>
